ABSTRACT = {Motion capture setups are used in numerous fields. Studies based on motion capture data can be found in biomechanical, sport or animal science. Clinical science studies include gait analysis as well as balance, posture and motor control. Robotic applications encompass object tracking. Today’s life applications includes entertainment or augmented reality. Still, few studies investigate the positioning performance of motion capture setups. In this paper, we study the positioning performance of one player in the optoelectronic motion capture based on markers: Vicon system. Our protocol includes evaluations of static and dynamic performances. Mean error as well as positioning variabilities are studied with calibrated ground truth setups that are not based on other motion capture modalities. We introduce a new setup that enables directly estimating the absolute positioning accuracy for dynamic experiments contrary to state-of-the art works that rely on inter-marker distances. The system performs well on static experiments with a mean absolute error of 0.15 mm and a variability lower than 0.025 mm. Our dynamic experiments were carried out at speeds found in real applications. Our work suggests that the system error is less than 2 mm. We also found that marker size and Vicon sampling rate must be carefully chosen with respect to the speed encountered in the application in order to reach optimal positioning performance that can go to 0.3 mm for our dynamic study.},

abstract = {Texting during walking has become a very common daily activity and could alter gait performance, especially during locomotion when additional visual attention is demanded, such as obstacle crossing. The purpose of this study was to examine biomechanical changes in obstructed gait characteristics while engaging in a phone texting activity. Gait analyses were performed on ten young healthy adults under the following two tasks: 1) walking and crossing an obstacle set at a 10% of the subject’s height and 2) walking and crossing an obstacle while responding to a text message. Whole body motion data were collected with a 10-camera motion capture system. Our data demonstrated that a conservative gait pattern was adopted while performing texting when approaching and crossing over the obstacle, which was indicated by slower walking speeds and greater toe-obstacle clearances. This gait pattern was, however, accompanied by a greater body sway in the frontal plane during crossing, which could be an indication of perturbed gait balance control. Increased visual-attentional demand from a concurrent phone texting could negatively impact young pedestrians’ safety during obstacle crossing.}

abstract = {We introduce a novel dataset containing 3-dimensional biomechanical and wearable sensor data from 22 able-bodied adults for multiple locomotion modes (level-ground/treadmill walking, stair ascent/descent, and ramp ascent/descent) and multiple terrain conditions of each mode (walking speed, stair height, and ramp inclination). In this paper, we present the data collection methods, explain the structure of the open dataset, and report the sensor data along with the kinematic and kinetic profiles of joint biomechanics as a function of the gait phase. This dataset offers a comprehensive source of locomotion information for the same set of subjects to motivate applications in locomotion recognition, developments in robotic assistive devices, and improvement of biomimetic controllers that better adapt to terrain conditions. With such a dataset, models for these applications can be either subject-dependent or subject-independent, allowing greater flexibility for researchers to advance the field.}
